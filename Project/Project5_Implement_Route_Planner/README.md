# isdc-implement-route-planner
ISDC Project - Implement a Route Planner using Python

In this project, I've applied A* search to implement a "Google-maps" style route planning algorithm and find the shortest path between two points.

This project includes the following files:
1. helpers.py - Contains helper functions for loading and displaying the maps.
2. map-10.pickle - Contains the map with 10 nodes.
3. map-40.pickle - Contains the map with 40 nodes.
4. project_notebook.ipynb - Jupyter notebook that contains all the instructions for the project
5. test.py - Contains function for testing the route planner implementation.
